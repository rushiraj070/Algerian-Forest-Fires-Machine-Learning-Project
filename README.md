# Algerian-Forest-Fires-Machine-Learning-Project

1. This is the very first end to end machine project of mine in which I have done EDA and FE on Algerian Forest Fire dataset and also visualized within the Jupyter Environment. Also train, tested ,prepared and pickled various models like linear, lasso and elasticnet (High Accuracy) for prediction of Relative humidity for various relative features.
2. Also made an application for prediction for the same in Flask Environment.
3. Also deployed the model in AWS environment using Beanstalk.

P.S. This project is strictly for self-learning and education purpose and not for any commercial use.
